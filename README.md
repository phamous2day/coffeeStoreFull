# Coffee Site Frontend

Having done - mostly - the backend, you are going to now build the frontend of the Coffee website using AngularJS. This app will have multiple pages, which means you will need to use ngRoute.

## The Pages

The page you'll need to build are:

1. The home page, which explains to the user what the site is about, and why they should buy coffee from here.
2. The options page, where the user will select the grind type and quantity to buy.
3. The delivery page, where the user will enter the address to delivery the coffee to.
4. The payment page, where they will review the order and submit credit card payment.
6. Thank you page, where they are redirected to after they submit an other.
7. The login page, where the user will login to the site. The following pages will require the user to login before he can access them:
  * options page
  * delivery page
  * payment page
8. The register page, where the user will register for an account on the site so that he can login.
